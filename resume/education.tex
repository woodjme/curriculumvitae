        {In September 2016 I started studying with The Open University in my own time. My main inspiration for doing this was to continue development of my technical skills driven by my interest in computer science, as well as to complete a personal goal of gaining a degree. Iâ€™ve found the course very enjoyable so far and am maintaining a very high standard of work. It has also proven to be a good social exercise with regular meet-ups between fellow students to discuss the content and the course and Computer Science in general.}
